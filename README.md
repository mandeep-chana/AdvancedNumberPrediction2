# Bidirectional LSTM Model with Convolutional Layer

## Overview
This project implements a neural network model using a combination of Convolutional and Bidirectional LSTM layers. It is designed for sequence modeling tasks, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP), or speech recognition.

### Key Features
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Uses forward and backward LSTM layers to capture information from both past and future time steps.
- **Convolutional Layer Integration**: Incorporates a convolutional layer before the LSTM layer to extract features from the input sequence.
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and speeds up convergence.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or Keras for neural network implementation

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git https://github.com/mandeep-chana/AdvancedNumberPrediction2.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The main model can be found in `lstm_model.py`. Below is an example of how to initialize and train the model:

```python
from model.lstm_model import build_model

# Load your data
X_train, y_train = load_data()

# Build and compile the model
model = build_model(input_shape=X_train.shape[1:])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Model Architecture
The neural network architecture includes:
1. A convolutional layer for feature extraction.
2. A Bidirectional LSTM layer with 460 units.
3. Batch Normalization for stable training.
4. Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.3.

## Example Code
The following snippet demonstrates the key components of the model:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, Bidirectional, LSTM, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

def build_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(460, return_sequences=True)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Adjust output layer as needed
    return model
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- You can adjust the number of LSTM units (`LSTM(460)`) based on your hardware capacity and dataset size.
- The `Dropout(0.3)` rate can be modified to control regularization.
- `return_sequences=True` is set for stacking LSTM layers or sequence output.

## Performance
- The model's performance may vary based on the dataset used. It's recommended to experiment with different hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques.
- Include a plot of model training accuracy and loss if applicable.
