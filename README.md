## Overview
The Advanced Number Predictor script is a comprehensive Python project that uses a mix of LSTM neural networks and ensemble machine learning models to predict numbers based on past data patterns. Optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune each model for enhanced accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes the frequency distribution of numbers in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts statistical features from sequences to enrich the input for models.
- **Model Ensemble**: Combines LSTM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees regressors.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilizes Optuna to optimize model hyperparameters.
- **Prediction**: Provides next number predictions based on ensemble-weighted results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-number-predictor.git
   cd advanced-number-predictor
Install required dependencies: Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install additional libraries (if not included in requirements.txt):

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn optuna matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Prepare Your Data:

Place your tab-separated data file (data.txt) in the root directory. Ensure it contains a single column of numeric data (e.g., lottery numbers).
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python advanced_number_predictor.py
Outputs:

Predicted numbers are saved to predictions.txt.
Model training logs are stored in ml_logs/.
Model checkpoints are saved in saved_models/.
Analysis plots are saved in analysis_plots/.
Configuration
Sequence Length: Set the sequence length (default is 15) in the AdvancedNumberPredictor class.
Logging: Logs are saved in the ml_logs/ directory with timestamps.
Model and Plot Directories: Saved models and analysis plots are located in saved_models/ and analysis_plots/, respectively.
Results
Final Predictions: The script generates 5 predictions based on the last sequence in the dataset.
Model Performance: Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE) for each model are printed to the console.
Optimization and Logging
Optuna: Automatically optimizes hyperparameters for each model using Optuna. Logs are saved with each trial's outcome, parameters, and the best configuration found.
Logging: Logging captures detailed information on each step, stored in ml_logs/.
