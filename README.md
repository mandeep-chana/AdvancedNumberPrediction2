# AdvancedNumberPredictor

`AdvancedNumberPredictor` is a machine learning-based tool for predicting sequential numeric patterns. The project uses a combination of LSTM neural networks and ensemble machine learning models to forecast future numbers based on historical sequences. It also employs various preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization to improve prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Removes outliers and scales data to enhance model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts statistical features from sequences (e.g., mean, standard deviation, skewness) to improve model performance.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Utilizes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees regressors, with hyperparameter optimization through Optuna.
- **LSTM Neural Network**: A deep learning model for sequential data prediction, optimized with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Prediction Refinement**: Post-processing ensures predictions are within valid bounds and align with recent trends.
- **Logging and Model Saving**: Logs are saved, and best models are stored for future use.

## Requirements
The project requires Python 3.x and the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `optuna`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Data: Place your dataset as data.txt in the root directory. This file should contain numerical data in a single column format.
Run the Script:
bash
Copy code
python predictor.py
Results:
Predictions will be displayed in the console.
A file named predictions.txt with predicted values will be created in the root directory.
Plots and logs are saved in analysis_plots and ml_logs respectively.
Example Prediction
plaintext
Copy code
=== Final Predictions ===
Next 5 numbers: [15, 32, 27, 4, 21]
Directory Structure
ml_logs/: Contains log files for model training and evaluation.
saved_models/: Stores the best models during training.
analysis_plots/: Saves plots generated during data analysis.
